You: Raven? Raven? I found something.
Raven: What did you find?
You: Looks like some schematics for some sort of missile.
Raven: Is there anything like a model number or a drawing code to identify it?
You: Hm...
You: No, it's unmarked.
Raven: Unmarked? Very unusual. Keep us in touch if you find something.
You: Roger Roger.
