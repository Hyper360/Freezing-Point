Raven: Find something new?
You: Yea, I think I learned more about the bioweapon
Raven: What did you find?
You: It looks like it is supposed to be deployed in combat
You: Not sure if it is already being used, but this could cause some real damage if used in the field
Raven: I will note that, keep up the good work
